U.S. Visa Evaluation Framework
This document outlines a hypothetical evaluation framework used by a consular officer to assess a visa applicant's eligibility under Section 214(b) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. The primary objective is to overcome the presumption of immigrant intent by demonstrating strong ties to the home country. The following 200 attributes are categorized and assigned a weight, with a total weight of 1000.
Example Contextual Statistics: Country X (FY 2024, B-Visas)
Refusal Rate: 24.70%
This rate is a significant factor in the overall risk assessment for applicants from Country X. It reflects a number of country-specific factors, including economic conditions, political stability, and the historical rate of visa overstays. The consular section is always mindful of these macro-level trends.
